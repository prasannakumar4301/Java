History of Java: 

James Gosling developed java in 1990's. 

Bcos of Green Project, James Gosling was unable to finish it using c++, hence he added some new concepts and 
rewritten c++ with additional capabilities and named it as Java.


Features: 

1. Object Oriented Programming Language 
2. Applications developed using Java are platform independent.
3. Robustness 
4. Security 
5. Multi-Threaded -> Multi tasking
6. Library on Data Structures -> Collection Framework

Environment Set up: 

1. Install Recent version of java 

2. Install Eclipse 

3. Visual Studio Code (Optional)

Building Blocks of Java:


First App in Java: 

Syntax: 

 class Classname{

// variables 
// methods

 }


class FirstApp{
  static public void main(String u[]){
       System.out.println("Hello!");
    }
} 


Key Points: 

1. Every file should have a class with main method. 

2. The compiler's job is to check for syntaxes only.

command:  javac <filename>.java 

If the compilation is successful, then compiler generates .class file 

3.  Java Virtual Machine is responsible for running a java class.

4. JVM looks for a main method with static,public keywords along with String[] args as parameter. 

public -> Visibility to JVM 

static -> For JVM to call the main method without creating object. 

String args[] -> taking input from the user. 

class FirstApp{
  static public void main(String args[]){
       //System.out.println("Hello!");
       System.out.println(Integer.parseInt(args[0]) + Integer.parseInt(args[1]));
    }
}
 
// Data - 10
// Class name should always starts with Uppercase
